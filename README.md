## Project Overview  
This project implements a **real-time drone flight control system** on FPGA hardware, starting with attitude estimation and progressively adding control algorithms and physics simulation.  
The goal is to demonstrate how **hardware acceleration** can significantly improve the performance of computationally intensive control systems compared to traditional software implementations.

**Current Status:**  *Project Update 1*  
**Feature:** Complementary Filter for Attitude Estimation — *Successfully implemented and synthesized*

### **Next Update – Integrated Control and Estimation System**  
**Target Date:** November – December 2024  
**Branch:** `next_update` *(in progress)*  

#### Planned Features  
- **Multi-Axis PID Control:** Independent loops for roll, pitch, yaw  
- **Motor Mixing Matrix:** Map control signals to motor PWM commands  
- **Fixed-Point Optimization:** Reduce resource usage and latency  
- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF):** Advanced sensor fusion and noise modeling  
- **Magnetometer Integration:** Yaw drift correction and fault handling  
- **Physics Simulation (6-DOF):** CPU-side drone dynamics model  
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL):** Real-time FPGA↔CPU co-simulation  
- **Visualization:** 3D trajectory and attitude display via Python  
- **Performance Comparison:** FPGA vs CPU execution speed, latency, and power  

#### Expected Improvements  
| Area | Anticipated Gain |
|:------|:----------------|
| Resource Utilization | ↓ 50 % via fixed-point conversion |
| Latency | 10× faster control response |
